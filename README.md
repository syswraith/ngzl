# ngzl

### Why?
Because its not even 10 pm and its a Tuesday night :/
Okay, for real, because I was trying to learn some of the basic libraries in python and this seemed like the ideal way to do that.

Usage is prohibited for nefarious purposes.

### How does it work?
- All the "bots" run a Python script that connects to an IRC server and to a particular channel.
- The bot herder issues commands in the channel.
- All the bots execute the commands on their end inside a subprocess (non-interactively, so you don't have to worry about clearing the history).
- They DM the output line-by-line to the botherder. Why line-by-line? Because the server rate-limits the input.
